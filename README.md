Simple lunch project to learn DevOps and its components.

FRONTEND

<b>input.gtpl</b> - HTML template to display the initial page of the app.
 
CONTROLLER

<b>sample-api-interface.py</b> - sample REST API interface for controller module.<br>
<b>sample-yelp-api.py</b> - sample REST API call to Yelp using API KEY and simple query of "location" and "radius".  Format results using json.  
<b>controller.py</b> - controller program servicing REST API for frontend, accepting zip/radius and return json.  Results generated by calling YelpAPI.

BACKEND

Database of all information collected.  Structured/Non-Structured, no matter.  It could be API to online services as well.
